# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! This project involves analyzing how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. The goal is to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Scenario

As a  data analyst on the Cyclistic marketing analytics team, I was tasked with understanding the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by different types of users. The insights gained from this analysis will help design a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## About Cyclistic

Cyclistic is a bike-share program in Chicago that offers over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. The program includes a variety of bikes, such as traditional bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it inclusive to people with disabilities and those who cannot use a standard two-wheeled bike.

## Business Task

### Objective
To understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

### Goals
1. Identify the differences in bike usage between annual members and casual riders.
2. Provide data-driven recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data for the previous 12 months, provided by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/data-license-agreement).

## Data Preparation

1. **Download Data**: Downloaded the previous 12 months of trip data.
2. **Organize Data**: Unzipped the files and stored them in appropriately named folders.
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Created `ride_length` column to calculate the length of each ride.
   - Created `day_of_week` column to calculate the day of the week each ride started.

## Data Processing

1. **Tools Used**: Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, R.
2. **Data Transformation**: Ensured data integrity by checking for errors and cleaning the data.
3. **Documentation**: Documented the cleaning and transformation process for reproducibility.

## Data Analysis

1. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Calculated mean, max, and mode of `ride_length`.
   - Created pivot tables to visualize average `ride_length` for members and casual riders.
2. **Trend Identification**: Identified trends and relationships between usage patterns of annual members and casual riders.

## Findings

- Annual members tend to have shorter, more frequent rides compared to casual riders.
- Casual riders are more likely to use bikes during weekends and holidays, whereas annual members use them more consistently throughout the week.
- There is potential to convert casual riders to annual members by targeting them with promotions during peak casual riding times.

## Recommendations

1. **Targeted Promotions**: Launch targeted promotions for casual riders during weekends and holidays.
2. **Membership Incentives**: Offer incentives such as discounts or added benefits for converting to annual membership.
3. **Digital Campaigns**: Utilize digital media to reach casual riders with personalized marketing messages.

## Visualizations

Included sophisticated and polished data visualizations to effectively communicate findings to the executive team.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides a clear understanding of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, leading to actionable recommendations for increasing annual memberships.
